Exercise 14-2
The film rental company manager would like to have a report that includes the name of every country, along with the total payments for all customers who live in each country. Generate a view definition that queries the country table and uses a scalar subquery to calculate a value for a column named tot_payments.

CREATE VIEW country_payments
AS
SELECT c.country,
 (SELECT sum(p.amount)
  FROM city ct
    INNER JOIN address a
    ON ct.city_id = a.city_id
    INNER JOIN customer cst
    ON a.address_id = cst.address_id
    INNER JOIN payment p
    ON cst.customer_id = p.customer_id
  WHERE ct.country_id = c.country_id
 ) tot_payments
FROM country c
