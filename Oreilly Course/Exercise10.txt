Exercise 10-1
Using the following table definitions and data, write a query that returns each customer name along with their total payments:

			Customer:
Customer_id  	Name
-----------  	---------------
1		John Smith
2		Kathy Jones
3		Greg Oliver

			Payment:
Payment_id	Customer_id	Amount
----------	-----------	--------
101		1		8.99
102		3		4.99
103		1		7.99

Include all customers, even if no payment records exist for that customer.

SELECT c.name, sum(p.amount)
	FROM customer c LEFT OUTER JOIN payment p
	ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
	GROUP BY c.name;



Exercise 10-2
Reformulate your query from Exercise 10-1 to use the other outer join type (e.g., if you used a left outer join in Exercise 10-1, use a right outer join this time) such that the results are identical to Exercise 10-1.

SELECT c.name, sum(p.amount)
    FROM payment p RIGHT OUTER JOIN customer c
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.name;



Exercise 10-3 (Extra Credit)
Devise a query that will generate the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100}. (Hint: use a cross join with at least two from clause subqueries.)
