Exercise 6-1
If set A = {L M N O P} and set B = {P Q R S T}, what sets are generated by the following operations?

A union B
A union all B
A intersect B
A except B

A union B = {L M N O P Q R S T}
A union all B = {L M N O P P Q R S T}
A intersect B = {P}
A except B = {L M N O}



Exercise 6-2
Write a compound query that finds the first and last names of all actors and customers whose last name starts with L.

SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM actor
	WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
	UNION
	SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM customer
	WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%';



Exercise 6-3
Sort the results from Exercise 6-2 by the last_name column.

SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM actor
	WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
	UNION
	SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM customer
	WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
	ORDER BY last_name;
